# Stock-Price-Prediction
Accurate stock price prediction plays a critical role in financial decision making, enabling investors and institutions to mitigate risk and optimize returns. Traditional forecasting techniques like ARIMA often fail to capture the non-linear, high-frequency patterns found in volatile markets. This project introduces a hybrid machine learning framework that leverages the strengths of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to forecast stock prices with higher precision. LSTM is employed to detect temporal dependencies from historical stock data, while XGBoost handles structured financial features like technical indicators for refined predictions. Historical stock data from Yahoo Finance is normalized and split into training and testing sequences. The LSTM-extracted features are passed to XGBoost, which models complex non-linear relationships, boosting accuracy and reducing overfitting. Results show that this hybrid model outperforms classical statistical methods and single-model baselines in both Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and computational efficiency. The integration of sequential learning and feature-based decision-making allows real-time application in stock markets, validating the proposed approach as a robust and scalable solution for stock price forecasting.
